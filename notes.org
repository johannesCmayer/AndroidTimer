Questions:

- Can the TimerExpiredBroadcast receiver be killed by android?
  - I want the alarm to go on indefinitely, or at least for maybe 5-10m. Should probably be configurable.

- How can I set a custom ringtone?

- What is an intent?

- How to stop the ringtone from within the app UI?
  - Do I need to create a seperate activity for this?

- How to display the alarm dismissal screen even when the phone is locked, without fully unlocking the phone?

- How to: Make the alarm autodissmiss after 10s of ringing, but then again start rining after 1 minute and 30 seconds?

- add vibration.
